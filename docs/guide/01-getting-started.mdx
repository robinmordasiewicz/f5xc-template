Welcome to your new documentation site. Edit this file and add more `.mdx` files under the `docs/guide/` directory to build out your content.

## Next Steps

1. Edit `docs/index.mdx` to set your site title and description
2. Add guide pages as numbered `.mdx` files (e.g., `02-installation.mdx`)
3. Push to `main` to trigger an automatic build and deploy
